Question 5: When writing a method, you must always include a(n)                             [ Select ]                          ["static identifier", "visibility indicator", "access modifier", "dynamic key"]           , a(n) return value , and the method name (in that order). Together, this is known as the method's                             [ Select ]                          ["method signature", "method name", "method identifier"]            

The correct answer is an access modifier because every method will start with an access modifier. This will tell the objects and classes which things it can access. The next answer is the return type. The return type is the data type that is required from the method that it will return. The return type can be null if needed. The last value is the method signature which is the name for the method. 

Question 8: String str = "Hello, there. My name is Joseph. What's yours?";
char c = str.charAt(7);
What is the value of c after running this code?(ken): 
The correct answer is 't'. The reason it is ‘t’ is because char c = str.charAt(7); is a character data type. A character data type will be store with ‘’ and since the 7th index in String str = "Hello, there. My name is Joseph. What's yours?" is t, that is what you get.
